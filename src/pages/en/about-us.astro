            <p class="first-p">
                We are an ambitious team of students creating a race car for the "Formula Student" competition. Our activities 
                cover the entire development process - from team formation, design, and prototype creation to manufacturing and 
                preparation for the international competition.
              </p>
              <p>
                When designing the vehicle, we focus on electric vehicle (EV) technologies. Our goal is not only to build a 
                competitive car but also to provide students with a real opportunity to apply the knowledge gained during their studies in 
                practice - in engineering, business, and project management.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our encourages collaboration, responsibility, and leadership - values that help each member grow and enable us to achieve ambitious goals together.

                "Formula Student" is one of the most prestigious engineering competitions in the world, bringing together university student engineers
                 from around the globe to showcase their skills in design, manufacturing, testing, and project management.
              </p>
              <p>
                The competition challenges teams both on and off the track. Teams must present a complete business plan, including marketing strategies, 
                manufacturing possibilities, and cost analysis, simulating the launch of a real-world product.
              </p>
